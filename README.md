# ðŸŒ± Explore ML  

Welcome! This repo is my space to explore topics in **Machine Learning, Math, and Data Science**.  
Iâ€™ll be sharing step-by-step tutorials, code examples, and intuition-driven explanations as I learn and experiment.  


## ðŸ““ Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks to play with the concepts:  
- [PCA Notebook](notebooks/pca.ipynb)  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Keep things simple, clear, and hands-on â€” so anyone curious about ML can follow along.

âœ¨ Stay tuned as I keep adding new explorations!

# 🌱 Explore AI  

Welcome! This is my repo to explore topics in **AI, Math, and Data Science**.  
Here you’ll find **step-by-step tutorials, code examples, and explanations**.  

## 📓 Notebooks  
Interactive Jupyter notebooks to understand and play with the concepts:  
- [PCA Notebook](notebooks/pca.ipynb)  

## 🎯 Goal  
Keep things **simple, clear, and hands-on**, while also explaining **the math behind the methods**.  
A basic understanding of **calculus and linear algebra** will help you follow along.

## 🚀 Coming Next  
- More tutorials on ML & math concepts  

## ⚙️ Requirements  
- Python 3.11.0  

Install dependencies with:
